# EfficientDet


EfficientDet is an object detection model introduced by Google Research in 2019. <br>It is designed to achieve a good balance between accuracy and efficiency in object detection tasks.<br> EfficientDet builds upon the EfficientNet architecture, which is known for its efficiency in terms of model size and computational cost.. <br>
Transfer learning can be a powerful technique to leverage pre-trained models like EfficientDet <br>
Efficientdet is a single shot object detector like SSD.Efficientdet models are pre-trained on the common objects in context(COCO) image database
